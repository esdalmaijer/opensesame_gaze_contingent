opensesame_gaze_contingent
==========================

Plugins for OpenSesame, introducing some gaze contingent functionality (e.g. for forced retinal locations)

OpenSesame is a graphical experiment builder for the social sciences, developed by Sebastiaan Mathot (see the
[website](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/about/)). Using the [EyeTracker plug-ins](https://github.com/esdalmaijer/opensesame_eyetracker),
one can add eye-tracking functionality to OpenSesame. The gaze contingent plug-ins are an implementation of a
number of gaze contingent paradigms, using the EyeTracker plug-ins as a basis.

Most of the gaze contingent plug-ins are ported from [PyGaze](http://www.fss.uu.nl/psn/pygaze/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGaze)),
a Python toolbox for eye-tracking research by Edwin Dalmaijer.
